Assalam-o-Alaikum sir,

Hope you are fine.

Dear sir,
The FYP presentations were due in the first week of October. I couldn't attend due to my illness. Actually, Dangue caught me and I was lying on bed for a few weeks. You know the effects of Dangue. Such kind of illness doesn't leave early. I went for my tests for Dangue 2 times with gap of 1 week. But the results were again positive. Therefore, I could not come to FYP presentations and meet the deadlines. I could not contribute in the FYP.

I again apology for the delay of FYP. I am again going for my Dangue tests this week. That is the cause for my absence in FYP. I hope this time the results are good so that I can start working on my FYP. Please consider this.
